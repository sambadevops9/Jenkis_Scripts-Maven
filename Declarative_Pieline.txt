Declarative Pipeline Steps:     https://digitalvarys.com/jenkins-declarative-pipeline-with-examples/
---------------------------

pipeline {
	agent…
	stages…
	step.. 
}

any – This means pipeline will run in any available node. (agent any)

none – Ideally None mean, the pipeline will run in not run in any agent at top-level, but each stage should be defined with its own agent ( agent none ).

label – This means the pipeline will be mentioned as label name and pipeline will look for the available node with the label name mentioned ( agent {label ‘my label name for node’} )

node – mentioning node in the agent is same as mentioning label but this will give us more option like custom Workspace ( agent {node{label ‘my label name’}}).

docker – By mentioning docker, the pipeline will run in a docker environment. ( agent{ docker {image ‘ruby3:develop’ label ‘my label name’ arg ‘—port 3000:80’} } ) )

Stages:
-------

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages { 
        stage('Example') {
		...
		...
        }
    }
}


Steps:
------

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps { 
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
    }
}
